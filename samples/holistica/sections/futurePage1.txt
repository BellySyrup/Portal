THE PAST: When we released the EPOC, we included software developer kits (SDKs) containing open-source code. Our goal was to allow people to use the EPOC in whichever way they saw fit - whether it was to create a new game or to simply turn on their espresso maker with a thought. What we've seen has amazed us, but not surprised us.

THE PRESENT: As expected, the EPOC has been put to use in many ways and what has emerged is an all-encompasing approach to improving our lives: by integrating brain-computer communication into our technological world, we can improve education, medical techniques, marketing, data-searching, construction, art, the list is inexaustive!

THE FUTURE: We are proposing nothing short of a new era.  In this time, the augmentation of our minds in the control of mechanical objects would serve to create new solutions to common day and unique problems.  Seemless, smooth, and intuitive interaction between ourselves and the devices we use on daily basis would make our work streamlined and efficient and our environments more responsive to our needs.

What if your home changed lighting levels depending on your mood? What if the radio played the music you were subconsciously wanting to hear?  What if you could know every time your student wasn't understanding a math concept?  What if disabled persons could mentally control their prostheses? What if we dared to improve our lives in a holistic approach?

What if Holistica?
